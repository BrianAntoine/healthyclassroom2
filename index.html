	<h3>What is Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)?</h3>
	<p>COVID-19 was first identified during an investigation into an 
		outbreak in Wuhan, China. It is a respiratory illness that can spread from person to person.</p>
	</div>
		
		<div class="c">  
	<h3>How does COVID-19 spread?</h3>
	<p>The virus probably emerged from an animal source, however, it now seems to be spreading from 
		person to person between people who are in close contact with one another (about 6 feet) and through
		respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The virus can live on 
		surfaces or objects, and therefore it is very important that you do not touch your mouth, nose, 
		or eyes after coming in contact with these surfaces. </p>
	</div>
		<div class="d">  
	<h3>What are the symptoms of COVID-19?</h3>
	<p>Symptoms generally appear 2-14 days after one is exposed to the virus, and the include fever, cough,
			and shortness of breath (these symptoms from mild to severe respiratory illness). Severe complications
			 may include pneumonia in both lungs.</p>
			</div>
			 <div class="e">  
	<h3>How to protect against COVID-19?</h3>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
			<li>The best prevention against this infection is to avoid being exposed to the virus that causes 
					COVID-19, therefore, avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
			<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands</li>
			<li>Wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. 
					Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not
					available</li>
		  </ul>
		</div>
		  <div class="f">  
	<h3>If you are sick, decrease the spread of respiratory illness to others by:</h3>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
			<li>Staying home </li>
			<li>Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash and 
				wash your hands</li>
			<li>Call ahead to your health care provider if you are sick and are seeking medical attention</li>
			<li>Always clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces</li>
		  </ul>
